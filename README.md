# fraud-detection-system
Developed a fraud detection system that analyzes financial transactions to identify suspicious activities and prevent fraudulent transactions. The system uses SQL queries for pattern detection and Python-based machine learning models for anomaly detection.

 Key Responsibilities & Implementation:
Database Management & SQL Analysis:

Designed a relational database schema for storing transaction records.
Used SQL queries to detect suspicious transactions based on unusual transaction amounts, high-frequency transfers, and location-based anomalies.
Implemented window functions and aggregations to identify suspicious trends.
Data Analysis & Preprocessing (Python):

Cleaned and processed financial transaction data using Pandas.
Used feature engineering to extract insights from transaction timestamps, location data, and payment methods.
Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection:

Applied Supervised Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
Implemented Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest, Autoencoders) for identifying unknown fraud patterns.
Evaluated model performance using precision-recall metrics and ROC-AUC curves.
Automation & Deployment:
